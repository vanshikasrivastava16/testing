doing some time pass. just because i am bored. i want to do random stuff. so i thought why not practise git by creating files and commiting the changes
so here i am doing this(haha emoji) .i will probably remove this file of course bacause i definately cannot let people read this random shit that i am 
writing just for my entertainment purpose .even i dont know what entertainment i am getting by writing this but neverthless its better than
doing nothing. now i think i must stop or else i can keep going on and on and on .theres no end to it by the way .i have so many things to tell
my mind is so full of thoughts all the time.
